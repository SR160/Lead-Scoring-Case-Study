# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Overview
X Education, an online education company, aims to improve its lead conversion rate by identifying the most potential leads. This project involves building a logistic regression model to assign lead scores to each lead, indicating the likelihood of conversion. The model will help prioritize leads for targeted communication strategies, ultimately increasing the lead conversion rate.
### Data
The dataset consists of around 9000 leads with various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable is 'Converted', indicating whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0).
### Goals
1. Build Logistic Regression Model: Develop a logistic regression model to assign lead scores between 0 and 100, indicating the conversion likelihood. Higher scores represent hotter leads with a higher chance of conversion.
2. Address Company Requirements: Ensure the model can adjust to company requirements and potential future changes. Provide recommendations based on the model's insights.
